# AtliQ_hardware_sales_finance_report

### 📝 Problem Statement

- Atliq Hardware is a hardware-based company that sells its products to other businesses across different markets worldwide. The company operates through multiple sales channels, including brick-and-mortar stores, e-commerce platforms, and direct distributors.

- The management team needs data-driven insights to understand customer performance, market trends, and overall sales efficiency. Although data is available for fiscal years 2018–2022, the focus of this analysis is on Fiscal Year 2021.

- My role was to analyze the sales, cost, and forecasting data using SQL queries and generate insights that support better decision-making for the business.

### 🔑 Key Terminologies :-

- Customer → Businesses that purchase products from Atliq, such as Amazon, Flipkart, Croma, Vijay Sales, etc.

- Market → Represents the country (e.g., India, Australia, USA) where Atliq sells its products.

- Platform →

  - Brick & Mortar :- Physical retail stores or stalls.

  - E-commerce :- Online platforms such as Amazon, Flipkart, etc.

- Channel →

   - Retailer :- Platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, and Croma.

   - Direct :- Atliq’s own stores, such as Atliq Exclusive or Atliq Store.

   - Distributor :- Well-known hardware specialists in each country who sell Atliq products further.

 - Forecast Accuracy → Measured by comparing the forecasted sales units against the actual sold quantity.

 - Fiscal Year (FY) → Runs from September to October (not January to December).
